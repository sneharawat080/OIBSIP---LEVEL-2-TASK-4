## Files

1. `login.html` - The login page where users can enter their username and password.
2. `register.html` - The registration page for new users to create an account.
3. `success.html` - The page displayed after a successful login or registration.

## Description

### Login Page

The login page (`login.html`) allows users to log in by entering their username and password. It includes form validation to ensure that both fields are filled out before submission. If the login is successful, the user is redirected to the `success.html` page.

### Registration Page

The registration page (`register.html`) enables new users to create an account by entering their first name, last name, email, username, and password. It includes form validation to ensure all fields are correctly filled out and the passwords match. Upon successful registration, the user is redirected to the `success.html` page.

### Success Page

The success page (`success.html`) confirms that the user has successfully logged in or registered. It provides a simple message indicating the successful operation.

## Usage

1. Open `register.html` in a web browser to create a new account.
2. Fill in the registration form and submit it.
3. After successful registration, you will be redirected to the `success.html` page.
4. Open `login.html` in a web browser to log in with your username and password.
5. Fill in the login form and submit it.
6. Upon successful login, you will be redirected to the `success.html` page.
